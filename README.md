# Boiler Optimization with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the performance of a boiler system.

## Description
- This notebook provides a comprehensive implementation of the PSO algorithm tailored to minimize a specific objective function in the boiler system.
- The objective function simulates a boiler problem with specific parameters and constraints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/boiler-pso.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook PSO(Boiler).ipynb
    ```
2. Run each cell to execute the code.

Alternatively, you can run the script as a Python file by converting the notebook:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script PSO(Boiler).ipynb
python PSO(Boiler).py
```

## Results

The notebook will generate various plots and outputs showcasing the optimization process and results. Key results include:
- Convergence plots
- Performance evaluation
- Optimized parameters
